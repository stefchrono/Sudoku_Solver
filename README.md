# Sudoku_Solver
This is an implementation of a backtracking algorithm showcased on Sudoku puzzles.

I have used Selenium to access Sudoku.com and to build an intelligent way of parsing sudoku table cell values, through html elements such as anchors, lists etc.

You will also find a '.mov' file, showcasing an implementation of the algorithm, applied on puzzles supplied by Sudoku.com.
